# EctoJob.Web

Work in progress UI for [ecto_job](https://github.com/mbuhot/ecto_job) built with [Phoenix LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view). You probably shouldn't use this for anything yet.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `ecto_job_web` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ecto_job_web, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/ecto_job_web](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto_job_live).
